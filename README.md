### Description:

This is my sumission for my 2nd project for Coder Academy. the purpose of this 
project is to showcase my ability in working with both HTML and CSS, as well as 
creating a base to work off and show off my talents as they grow.


### Functionality / features:

#### Navbar
    who doesn't love a good navbar, links between all the pages in the document 
    allowing you to jump through each of the pages without having to manually 
    type in the address.

#### Blog
    a mock up of a blog which could be used to document my journey from learning 
    the basic concepts to being a junior full stack developer. where I can write 
    out my thoughts and ideas as I learn.

#### Access to my CV
    making it easy for potential employers to see my employment and study history. 
    Also useful in this format because it is a little bit easier than remembering 
    where I had last put my documentation. and only have to give out a URL rather 
    than updating each time I have to send off the document because it's always in 
    one place.

#### Contact page
    Can be linked to all my professional and social media accounts. making it easier 
    for people to get in contact. Also a quick email section which sends emails 
    directly to the connected email address.
