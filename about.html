    <p> We are Matt - Coding, Gaming and Kidneys

        Did you know it takes roughly 2 months to learn how to perform Dialysis on yourself?
        
        At the age of 23 I suffered kindney failure, going through a whirlwind of treatment, tests, jargon and a whole
        new way I had to take care of myself. There are some similarities between Dialysis and learning Ruby.

        I started my journey in to coding and web development in 2019, doing simple excersises with my partners dad
        to get a handle on the subject later signing up to study with coder academy in 2020, leaving behind a very glamorous
        career in front-line retail.

        steadily growing my skills and combating my own laziness and imposter syndrome are what I'm here for.
